# auth-api
[Heroku](https://alfredo-auth-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment
Your server must be deployed at Heroku.
If it requires a database, provision it.
For APIs, your endpoints should all be testable remotely using an HTTP REST client.
For Web Servers, your website must be reachable.

## Testing
Write a complete set of tests for all data models, independent of the server
Use an in-memory SQL dialect to test your Postgres Models.
For testing the server and routes, make sure you initialize the database before your tests run.
What weâ€™re testing is not whether express works, but whether your routes are doing the correct things.
Your tests must be running green on Github Actions.
